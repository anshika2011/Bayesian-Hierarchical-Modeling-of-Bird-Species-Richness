# Bayesian-Hierarchical-Modeling-of-Bird-Species-Richness
Species richness, the count of distinct bird species, is modeled using a Bayesian hierarchical Negative Binomial approach. The model accounts for effort, seasonal patterns (via Fourier basis), and spatial variability with state-level random effects. Gibbs sampling in JAGS estimates posteriors and ensures convergence.
